"By Following this readme document, you may understand the files and their usage."
"This is used for Reinforcement Learning Modeling Club. There are two folders: references, rcodes"
"Outside is the slides that is used in modeling club, following the slides, you are able to know about reinforcement learning and how we construct models step-by-step."
"Inside the reference folder, there are some essays mentioned in the slides, so in convenience you can directly get access to them instead of finding online. There might be some other papers that are not mentioned. But they are relevant so I hope they can be useful!"
"In the Rcodes folder, there are two subfolders: rcodes and exercies. Rcodes contains all codes we use to present the slides, run the simulation and interactive demos. If you are more interested and chanllenging, you can try exercise codes and implement the incompleted codes to replicate our results. Hope this can make you a head start on simulation."
"If you have any questions, you can email hanboxie1997@163.com to me."
"To watch the video, you can visit  https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pB4y1c7yh?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0  in RL chapter."
Enjoy your RL journey!
